CNN-SVM

The Python Notebook file I have mentioned has the script I have executed to apply preprocessing on images and for proposing a sample model with CNN-SVM
Note: Due to Slow internet in our area,I couldn't able to upload the complete data set in One drvie as well as Git hub, hence I have executed it locally. Though, I have initiated for uploading the file to git hub ,Hopefully it will get uploaded soon.Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
